Analysis

1. Which Category generates the most Sales?
2. Which Category is most Profitable / Loss-making?
3. How does Discount impact Profit?

🔹 ANALYSIS 1: Sales by Category
Created a Pivot Table with Catogory in Rows, Sum of Sales in Values.

Technology category contributes the highest overall sales, followed by Furniture and Office Supplies.”

🔹 ANALYSIS 2: Profit by Category
Technology leads both in sales and profitability, making it the strongest performing category. Furniture shows moderate profitability, while Office Supplies contributes the least to overall profit.

🔹 ANALYSIS 3: Discount vs Profit
Discounts above 30% consistently result in losses, while orders with 0–20% discounts remain profitable. The majority of total profit comes from non-discounted sales

🧠 Business Interpretation

High discounts reduce margins drastically
Discounting does not always increase volume enough to offset losses
Aggressive promotions harm profitability

Insights
1. Technology is the top-performing category in both sales and profit.
2. Orders without discounts contribute the highest share of total profit.
3. Discounts above 30% consistently lead to losses, with the highest losses at 70–80% discount levels.
4. Moderate discounts (10–20%) maintain profitability, suggesting an optimal discount range.

Act 
Recommentations
1. Avoid offering discounts above 30%
2. Focus on 0–20% discount strategies
3. Prioritize Technology category for revenue growth
4. Re-evaluate high-discount promotions that lead to losses


I used Pivot Charts linked to Pivot Tables to clearly visualize key metrics such as category-wise profit and discount impact. This allows quick insights and dynamic filtering.

Final Conclusion
Using Excel, I analyzed a retail sales dataset to evaluate category performance and the impact of discounts on profitability. The analysis revealed that Technology is the most profitable category. Additionally, non-discounted and moderately discounted (10–20%) orders contribute positively to overall profit, while discounts above 30% consistently result in losses. These findings suggest that limiting high-discount strategies can significantly improve business profitability.
